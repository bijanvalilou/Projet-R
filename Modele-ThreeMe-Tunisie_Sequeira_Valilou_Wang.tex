\subsection{Energy and economy framework in Tunisia
(Jin)}\label{energy-and-economy-framework-in-tunisia-jin}}

Tunisia is one of the northernmost countries in Africa, ranked the most
competitive economy in Africa by World Economy Forum in 2009
\autocite{tunisia2022}. The local economy is largely oriented towards
services, which account for 43\% of GDP in 2019
\autocite{worldbank2020}, including the booming IT and tourism
industries. Agriculture is another key sector of the Tunisian economy,
representing 10.4\% of the GDP and employing 12.7\% of the working
population \autocite{worldbank2020}. Thanks to technical progress of
agricultural sector, Tunisia is one of the most productive countries in
Africa. Tunisia's industry represents 22.7\% of GDP and employs 32.5\%
of the working population in 2020 \autocite{bnpparibas}. The industrial
sectors are mainly export oriented especially for manufacturing, Europe
is the destination for more than 75\% of Tunisia's exports
\autocite{worldbank2020}.

Since the Jasmine Revolution on 2011, Tunisia economy has been suffered
from the extended recession. The sanitary crisis on 2020 has worsened
the already precarious situation. Actually, even before COVID-19
Tunisia's capacity for economic resilience had been drained by years of
indecisive public policy-making and growing protectionism
\autocite{worldbank}. In early September 2020, the Tunisian parliament
finally reversed a government of Tenchnocrats in an attempt to remedy
the country's economic situation \autocite{bnpparibas}.

Along with the sluggish economy is the huge energy deficit in Tunisia.
\textcite{irena2021} reported that energy deficit (50\% in 2019) has
existed in Tunisia over the past two decades, mainly because of the
increasing consumption but with the stagnated even declined domestic
production in recent years. \textcite{giz} reported that Tunisia depends
for 60\% on energy imports, and this number is continuously raising. The
energy transition project proclaimed in 2014 aims to reduce energy needs
by 34\% by 2030, lower subsidies and establish incentive mechanisms
favoring profitable and climate friendly investments. However, the
challenging is the lack of reliable institutional mechanisms and
motivation for enterprises to participate, accompanied with a poorly
established service market and weak transmission of knowledge to
citizens, especially outside urban area.

\subsubsection{Energetic subsidy (Bee)}\label{energetic-subsidy-bee}}

Subsidies are defined by \textcite{demoor1997} as \emph{`any measure
that keeps prices for consumers below the market level or keeps prices
for producers above the market level or that reduces costs for consumers
and producers by giving direct or indirect support'}. Energy subsidies
are a common policy. Their amount is estimated at \$4.7 trillion in 2015
as pointed out \textcite{coady2019}, which is equivalent to 6.3 percent
of Gross Domestic Product . Energy subsidies fluctuate depending on the
price of the energy products. From the database of the International
Energy Agency, we can notice that the fossil fuel subsidies have
\href{https://www.iea.org/topics/energy-subsidies}{fallen by 42 percent
between 2019 and 2020} due to the drop of fuel prices.

The energy subsidies are very present in the Middle East, North Africa,
Afghanistan and Pakistan region (MENAP). According to
\textcite{coady2019}, MENAP is the fourth region in absolute terms,
which subsidized the most energy in 2015. Nevertheless, in relative
terms, MENAP is the second, if we take into account the percent of its
GDP. The prevalence of energy subsidies in MENAP can be explained by
post-par period. \textcite{verme2017} explain that theses energy
subsidies were introduced in Middle East and North Africa region (MENA)
in order to stabilize prices after the decolonization. These
stabilization mechanisms became a social protection system.

(Lucia)}\label{recycle-of-gouvernment-income-for-tax-lucia}}

According to \textcite{goulder}, tax redistribution is the mechanism
that allows the government to return to the private economy the revenues
that are produced by the instrument. There are many ways in which this
redistribution can operate. It can be presented as a lump-sum transfer
to households and firms, or as a reduction of taxes that introduce a
deformation into the economy as is the case of the labor tax.

with/without redistribution? *Voir si peut être on déplace cette partie

We work on six different scenarios that simulate the implementation of
six alternative environmental policies.

Scenario 1 : Implementation of a carbon tax from 2021 without
redistribution of the revenues of the tax in the economy - they are used
to reduce public debt.

Scenario 2 : Carbon tax with recycling of revenues that are redirected
to the Energy Transition Fund. In fact, a part is given back to
households and a portion is devoted to ``non-polluting'' businesses.

Scenario 3 : Fossil fuels subsidies removal (without recycling).

Scenario 4 : Fossil fuels subsidies removal (with recycling). A part is
given back to households and a portion is given to enterprises in
proportion to the employment of each sector in the total salaried labor
force.

Scenario 5 : Significant penetration of Renewable Energies in the
electrical mix (80\% by 2050)

Scenario 6 : Combination of scenarios 2, 4 and 5.

\hypertarget{kaya-identity-jin}{%
\subsubsection{Kaya identity (Jin)}\label{kaya-identity-jin}}

The Kaya identity, firstly proposed by \autocite{kaya1989}, is an
identity where the total emission of carbon dioxide can be explained by
four product driving forces as population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
per capita, enerny intensity over GDP and carbon intensity over energy
consumption \autocite{kayaide2021}. It is expressed in the form:

\[ C = POP \cdot \frac{GDP}{POP} \cdot \frac{TEC}{GDP} \cdot \frac{C}{TEC} \tag{1}\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  POP is global population;
\item
  GDP is gross domestic product;
\item
  TEC is total energy consumption;
\item
  C is total emission of carbon dioxide;
\end{itemize}

And:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  GDP/POP is GDP per capita describing the economical activities within
  a period;
\item
  TEC/GDP is energy intensity;
\item
  C/TEC is carbon intensity;
\end{itemize}

In this study, we introduced an extension of Kaya identity to explain
how different driving forces influenced the total emission for different
scenarios. Firstly, a extended Kaya identity is used to analysis
CO\textsubscript{2} emission with the aggregated factors, then we couple
with Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method to decomposite
CO\textsubscript{2} emission at the sectorial level.

We modified the function of Kaya identity mentioned above to adapt our
model assumption, where we integrated a new driving force, named economy
structure, to decomposite emissions driving force at sectorial level.
The five economic sectors considered in ThreeME Tunisia model are:
Industry and Agriculture, Service, Transportation, Energy Transformation
and Electricity. However, we did not take population into consideration
because its increasing rate remains still over time for all our
scenarios and is considered as an exogenous variable in ThreeME model.

Therefore, the CO\textsubscript{2} emission can be written as:

\[  C_{tot} = \Sigma C_{i} = \Sigma( VA \cdot \frac{VA_{i}}{VA} \cdot \frac{EC_{i}}{VA_{i}} \cdot \frac{CE_{i}}{EC_{i}} )=  \Sigma( V \cdot S_{i} \cdot E_{i} \cdot I_{i}) \tag{2}\]
where C\textsubscript{tot} is overall CO\textsubscript{2} emission,
C\textsubscript{i} is CO\textsubscript{2} emission of economic sector i,
VA is total added value, VA\textsubscript{i} is added value of sector i,
EC\textsubscript{i} is total energy consumption by sector i,
CE\textsubscript{i} is CO\textsubscript{2} emission arising from sector
i. According to equation 8, total CO\textsubscript{2} emission can be
explained by four driving forces, including one aggregated indicator,
overall economic activities V, and three sectorial indicators, share of
total added value of sector i S\textsubscript{i}, energy intensity over
added value of sector i E\textsubscript{i} and carbon intensity over
energy consumption of sector i I\textsubscript{i}. Especially,
S\textsubscript{i} can be interpreted as economy structure of Tunisia,
\textcite{grubb2015} and \textcite{kanitkar2015} found that for a
developing country, this term could be a key variable determining the
future emissions pathway.

The effects of driving forces can be expressed in two ways:
multiplicative and additive form, where multiplicative deviation
\(D_{tot}\) is the ratio of total CO\textsubscript{2} emission between
policy scenario and baseline scenario (equation 3), and additive
deviation \(\Delta C_{tot}\) is the difference of total
CO\textsubscript{2} emission (equation 4). The two expressions are shown
below:

\[ D_{tot} =\frac{C_{2}}{C_{0}} = \Pi(\frac{V_{2}}{V_{0}} \cdot \frac{S_{2,i}}{S_{0,i}} \cdot \frac{E_{2,i}}{E_{0,i}}  \cdot \frac{I_{2,i}}{I_{0,i}}) = D_{V}  \cdot  D_{S} \cdot D_{E} \cdot D_{I} = D_{V}  \cdot \Pi ( D_{S_{i}} \cdot D_{E_{i}} \cdot D_{I_{i}}) \tag{3}\]

\[ \Delta C_{tot} = C_{2} - C_{0} = \Delta C_{V} + \Delta C_{S} + \Delta C_{E} + \Delta C_{I} = \Delta C_{V} + \Sigma( \Delta C_{S_{i}} + \Delta C_{E_{i}} + \Delta C_{I_{i}}) \tag{4}\]
where subscript \(tot\) represents overall change of emission, subscript
0 and 2 mean baseline scenario and policy scenario respectively. Hence
we obtain the index \(D_{V}\), \(D_{S}\), \(D_{E}\) and \(D_{I}\),
meaning the deviation of emissions due to change of overall economic
activities, economy structure, energy intensity and carbon intensity,
while \(\Delta C_{V}\), \(\Delta C_{S}\), \(\Delta C_{E}\) and
\(\Delta C_{I}\) depict the difference of emissions related to change of
driving forces.

Now we expect to identify the effect of each driving force at a
sectorial level, to do this, we used a LMDI method proposed by
\textcite{ang1997} and \textcite{ang2005}. For multiplicative form, we
have:

\[ D_{X} = exp ( \Sigma \frac{(C_{2,i}-C_{0,i})/(lnC_{2,i}-lnC_{0,i})}{(C_{2}-C_{0})/(lnC_{2}-lnC_{0})} \cdot ln \frac{X_{2,(i)}}{X_{0,(i)}} ) \tag{11}\]
\[ \Delta C_{X} =  \Sigma (\frac{C_{2,i}-C_{0,i}}{lnC_{2,i}-lnC_{0,i}} \cdot ln\frac{X_{2,(i)}}{X_{0,(i)}}) \tag{12} \]
where \(C_{2}\) is total emission of policy scenario, \(C_{0}\) is total
emission of baseline, \(C_{2,i}\) is emission of policy scenario arising
from sector i, \(C_{0,i}\) is emission of baseline arising from sector
i, \(D_{X}\) and \(\Delta C_{X}\) represent multiplicative and additive
index of driving force \(X\), \(X_{2,(i)}\) is value of driving force
\(X\) of policy scenario for sector i, \(X_{0,(i)}\) is value of driving
force \(X\) of baseline for sector i.

In this section we will analyse the results obtained for the different
scenarios for the different variables taken into account.

\hypertarget{importance-of-redistribution-lucia}{%
\subsection{Importance of redistribution
(Lucia)}\label{importance-of-redistribution-lucia}}

Here we will analyse the influence of the redistribution of both the tax
and the removed energy subsidy. We will observe the impact of the
redistribution on the economical and environmental aspects. We will
focus on GDP variation and unemployment when it comes to the economical
aspect and we will analyse the evolution of emissions for the
environmental aspect.

Firstly, we will analyse the redistribution of the carbon tax. The
figure below show the variation in GDP in relation to the baseline for
both the scenarios carbon tax with and without redistribution. We
observe that the evolution of the curves is opposite and symmetric in
relation to the x-axis, the scenario with redistribution showing a
marked increase in GDP.

\includegraphics{Modele-ThreeMe-Tunisie_Sequeira_Valilou_Wang_files/figure-latex/unnamed-chunk-8-1.pdf}

Then when we analyse the \emph{level of employment} we can see that the
redistribution operates an increase on it in relation to the baseline,
when the scenario of a carbon tax without redistribution produce a
decrease in the level of employment. That is consistent with the fact
that the

\hypertarget{carbon-tax-jin-1}{%
\subsection{Carbon tax (jin)}\label{carbon-tax-jin-1}}

As the carbon tax before 2030 stays at a moderate level, the impacts of
this policy are therefore limited, while the significant effects are
observed during the later period from 2030 to 2050 when a much stronger
tax carbon is implemented. The macroeconomic impacts are summarized in
table 1, the results are expressed as percentage deviation from Baseline
scenario.

Generally speaking, the policy of carbon tax with redistribution of
government revenue has a positive impact on Tunisia's economy. Whereas
GDP increases slightly up to 0.13\% with respect to baseline on 2030,
the relatively rapid augmentation is observed from 2030 to 2050. At the
horizon of 2050, it reaches a highest level (+1.93\%) thanks to the
carbon tax policy. In the meantime, social welfare is improved with the
same rhythme as GDP growth, with a higher consumption level (+4.20\%)
and a higher disposable income (+4.17\%) on 2050.

Table.X :Macroeconomic impacts of Carbon tax scenario in \% deviation to
Baseline

An intuitive influence of carbon tax is that the price of internal
market will raise, which is in line with our model output: higher
household consumption price of 9.49\% with 11.33\% and 13.14\% for
production price and intermediate consumption price, respectively. The
increasing cost of household and company will force them to choose the
substitution with less CO2 emissions, thus reducing their cost. The
variation of internal price also has an impact on the competitiveness of
local goods on international market, causing a recession for exportation
and a boost for importation.

It is interesting to note that the implemented policy can alleviate
social poverty to some extent. We observed, for example, the continuous
growth of wage employment. It will reinforce the acceptability of the
climate policy.

As the economy grows, we find that the emissions reduction of 42.2\% by
2050 is achieved. We are now interested in its pathway, to do this, we
firstly employ our extended Kaya identity to clarify the main driving
forces, where, a priori, Economic activities are expected to have
positive effects on emissions, whilst Energy intensity and Carbon
intensity should have negative effects. Figure X. et X. present the
results of all the aggregated driving forces. We observe that economy
structure has a significantly positive and growing impact until 2043
where it reaches the peak raising 7947.48 Kt CO2 (+19,38\%) with regard
to baseline, then it begins to decline to 5650,17 Kt CO2 (+12,46\%) on
2050. On the other hand, carbon intensity and energy intensity show the
negative and monotone trend, the former reducing 7128.35 Kt CO2
(-13.77\%) on 2050 and 30715.93 Kt CO2 (-47.18\%) for the later.
However, the influence of economic activities is negligible (+886,37 Kt
CO2 \& +1.86\%), revealing that even though the total production remains
relatively invariable, the revolution of economy structure could still
strongly impact the emissions pathway.
